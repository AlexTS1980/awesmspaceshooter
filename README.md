Awesome Space Shooter v 3.0.1

I developed this turn-based space shooter game to implement A* pathfinding algorithm for enemies. All sprites and sounds have been found in the open sources. Main features are:

- select the number of enemies,
- select the number of laser charges (weak) and missiles (strong),
- select the number of asteroids (obstacles),
- select the number of hit points.
